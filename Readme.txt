						==============================
						Matrix Calculator Android App
						==============================

Overview:
---------
This Android application allows users to perform matrix operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two matrices. The matrices can be dynamically generated by the user by specifying the number of rows and columns for both matrices.

Key Features:
-------------
1. User can input the dimensions of two matrices (Matrix A and Matrix B).
2. The app generates editable grid views for both matrices where users can input the elements.
3. Users can choose one of the following operations:
   - Add
   - Subtract
   - Multiply
   - Divide (requires Matrix B to be square and invertible)
4. After performing the chosen matrix operation, the result is displayed in a grid format.
5. Matrix calculations are handled by a native C++ function using JNI (Java Native Interface) and Eigen C++ library for efficient matrix computations.

Requirements:
-------------
1. Android Studio installed on your system.
2. Android SDK with the necessary build tools.
3. JNI setup for native C++ code.

Getting Started:
----------------
1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the project in Android Studio.
3. Ensure that you have the Android NDK installed (for the native C++ code to function).
4. Sync the project with Gradle files to ensure all dependencies are resolved.
5. Build and run the app on an emulator or a physical device.

How to Use:
------------
1. Launch the app.
2. Enter the number of rows and columns for Matrix A and Matrix B.
3. Tap the "Generate A" button to generate input fields for Matrix A.
4. Tap the "Generate B" button to generate input fields for Matrix B.
5. Input the values of both matrices in the respective grid.
6. Select the desired matrix operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, or Divide) from the dropdown menu.
7. Tap the "Calculate" button to perform the operation.
8. The result matrix will be displayed below.

Matrix Operations:
------------------
1. **Addition (A + B)**: Matrices must have the same dimensions.
2. **Subtraction (A - B)**: Matrices must have the same dimensions.
3. **Multiplication (A * B)**: The number of columns of Matrix A must equal the number of rows of Matrix B.
4. **Division (A / B)**: Matrix B must be square (number of rows = number of columns) and invertible (determinant not equal to zero).

Dependencies:
------------
- **Eigen C++ Library**: Used for efficient matrix operations in the native code.
- **Android SDK**: Used for building the Android app.
- **JNI (Java Native Interface)**: Allows calling the native C++ matrix calculation code from Java/Kotlin.

Project Structure:
-----------------
- **MainActivity.kt**: The main activity that handles the user interface and matrix operations.
- **activity_main.xml**: The layout file that defines the structure of the UI.
- **native-lib.cpp**: Contains the C++ code for matrix calculations using Eigen.
